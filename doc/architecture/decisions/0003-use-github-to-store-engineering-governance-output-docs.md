# 3. Use GitHub to store Engineering Governance output docs

Date: 2024-03-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The output of the AT&S Engineering Governance group should be transparent and visible to all interested parties.

## Decision

The proposal is that we use GitHub for recording and sharing decisions and outcomes from the AEG group.
Dropbox does not have sufficient support for rich markup and is difficult to navigate.
Confluence does not have sufficient support for rich markup.
GitHub is traditionally where engineering and architectural decision records are stored for individual projects.

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated.
